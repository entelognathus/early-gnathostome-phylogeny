> Giles *et al*. (2015): "Hanke & Davis (2008) express uncertainty about bone cell lacunae in the scale bases of *Gladiobranchus*. However, Newman *et al*. (2012), working on the basis of better-preserved material of *Uraniacanthus* (to which *Gladiobranchus* is synonymous) show convincingly that these lacunae are lacking. *Climatius* is scored '?' in spite of Ørvig's (1967) report of acellular bases. Ørvig figured flat-based scales from the head. This character strictly concerns body scales, which may have been different. *Cheirolepis* is scored '1' based on Ørvig (1967). However, this is remarkably poorly documented in any accessioned specimens. *Acanthodes* is scored '1' based on Gross (1947) and Valiukevicius (1995). *Dialipina* is scored from Schultze (1968). *Psarolepis* is coded '0' based on Qu *et al*. (2013). The presence or absence of bone cells in the scale bases of *Brindabellaspis* is uncertain based on Burrow & Turner (1999)."

> Score changed from 0 to 1 for Galeaspida. *Lophosteus* and *Andreolepis* are scored '0' based on Gross (1968, 1969) and Jerve *et al*. (2016).

26. Main dentinous tissue forming fin spine: (0) osteodentine; (1) orthodentine.

> Burrow & Turner (2010), Character 60; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 12; Choo *et al*. (2017), Character 260; King *et al*. (2017), Character 13; Castiello (2018), Character 13; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Character 26; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 16.

 *Squamation & related structures*

27. Longitudinal scale alignment in fin webs: (0) present; (1) absent.

> Brazeau (2009), Character 7; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 7; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 13; Choo *et al*. (2017), Character 6; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Character 27.

> Giles *et al*. (2015):" The character formulation of Davis *et al*. (2012) did not distinguish between ordered arrangements of fin scales and lepidotrichia. Acanthodians and *Dialipina* (uncatalogued specimen, Musem für Naturkunde, Berlin) exhibit fin web scales that are not markedly distinguished from the body scales. Fin web scales of *Dialipina* even include a distinct peg-and-socket articulation. This character thus refers to the alignment only, but not to the specialized rectangle-shaped scales in osteichthyans. *Poracanthodes* is changed to '?' because fin webs do not appear to be preserved in articulated specimens (Valiukevicius 1992). *Brachyacanthus* and *Parexus* scored '1' (pers. obs. SG, NHMUK P.130, P.38593 for *Parexus*, and NHMUK P.6959 and P.9595 *Brachyacanthus*). *Brochoadmones* is scored '0' based on observations on UALVP 41495. *Campbellodus* scored '?'."

> Giles *et al*. (2015): "Refers to the distinct rectangular shape of the aligned lepidotrichia-like scales. 
This character is scored contingently on the state of the previous character. *Dialipina* is coded '0' (uncatalogued specimen, Musem für Naturkunde, Berlin)."

29. Epichordal lepidotrichia in caudal fin: (0) absent; (1) present.

> Zhu  *et al*. (2009, Character 142), and references therein; Zhu *et al*. (2013), Character 146; Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 236; Choo *et al*. (2017), Character 140; King *et al*. (2017), Character 470; Castiello (2018), Character 459; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Character 29; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 475.

(2017), Character 467; Castiello (2018), Character 456; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Character 31; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 472.

> Taxa without lepidotrichia are coded as 'logical impossibility'.

32. Scute-like ridge scales (basal fulcra): (0) absent; (1) present.

33. Flank scale alignment: (0) vertical rows; (1) oblique rows or hexagonal/rhombic packing; (2) disorganised.

> Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 14; Choo *et al*. (2017), Character 13; King *et al*. (2017), Character 491; Castiello (2018), Character 481; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Character 33; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 496.

34. Body scale growth pattern: (0) monodontode (monocuspid); (1) polyodontode (multicuspid).

> Hanke & Wilson (2004); Brazeau (2009); Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 8; Choo *et al*. (2017), Character 7; Coates *et al*. (2018), Character 9; King *et al*. (2017), Character 485; Castiello (2018), Character 474; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Character 35; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 490.

> Coates *et al*. (2018): "*Gladbachus* scale crowns consistently meet the multicuspid condition. *Gladbachus* scales have been described as placoderm-like (Burrow & Turner 2013; Brazeau & Friedman 2014) and appear to have increased in size by the addition of dentine tubercles. The resultant patterns resemble closely those identified as *Ohioaspis*, attributed to the rhenanid *Asterosteus* (Gross 1973; Denison 1978) and used in the present matrix to score scale characteristics for rhenanids *Gemuendina* and *Jagorina*. This growth mode is areal, used by Brazeau and Friedman (2014) to characterise complexes of 'appositionally joined odontodes'."

> *Entelognathus* scales bear appositionally joined odontodes (Cui *et al*. in review).

35. Body scale growth concentric: (0) absent; (1) present.

> Hanke & Wilson (2004); Brazeau (2009), Character 9; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 9; Choo *et al*. (2017), Character 8; King *et al*. (2017), Character 486; Castiello (2018), Character 475; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Character 36; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 491.

> Brazeau (2009): "Body scale odontodes growing in concentric “onion skin” pattern: absent (0); present (1). This characterises the generalised concentric growth of odontodes around a single scale primordium seen in many acanthodian-type taxa and often used to diagnose acanthodians as a group. Taxa for which the superimposed odontodes do not cover the top of the crown (i.e. *Brochoadmones* and *Poracanthodes*) are scored “0”."

> Davis *et al*. (2012): "This character is not equivalent the ‘superpositional’ character state used by Hanke & Wilson (2004). More precisely, it refers to the classic mode of acanthodian scale growth depicted in texts from Moy-Thomas & Miles (1971) onwards, and exemplified by *Acanthodes* and *Nostolepis* (shown again by Burrow & Turner 2010). Thus *Brochoadmones* (and similar taxa) coded by Hanke & Wilson (2004) and Burrow & Turner (2010) as sharing the same general superpositional mode of flank scale growth, is here coded as different (mid-sagittal sections of scales shown in Hanke & Wilson 2006)."

> Dearden *et al*. (2021): "As Miles (1973) observed, the flank scales of *Dobunnacanthus* gen. nov. are ornamented with anteroposteriorly aligned ridges (Fig. 13C, D). These appear to be very similar to the scales of *Vernicomacanthus*, with their laterally apposed odontodes. However, because the internal structure of the scales is not preserved, it is impossible to definitively diagnose this."

36. Body scales with peg-and-socket articulation: (0) absent; (1) present.

> The coding of *Andreolepis hedei* is changed from 1 to 0 (Chen *et al*., 2012). The coding of *Raynerius splendens* is changed from 1 to unapplicable because the scales are devoid necks (Giles *et al*., 2015 Fig. 2e).

> The coding of *Entelognathus primordialis* is changed from unapplicable to 1 based on new data.

> Unknown in *Janusiscus schultzei*. The scales (GIT 496-8 to 496-16) are found from the same locality and horizon as the skull specimens (GIT 496-6, GIT496-7), but “cannot be definitely associated with cranial material” (Giles  *et al*., 2015). Follow this statement, the scale features in *Janusiscus schultzei* are coded ‘unknown’ in all the later data sets. GIT 496-8 to 496-16 (http://geokogud.info/git/specimen_image/496/496-8.jpg to http://geokogud.info/git/specimen_image/496/496-16.jpg) show the presence of the peg-and-socket articulation, and the absence of the anterodoral process of the scale. This uncertainty also results in the drifting phylogenetic resolution of *Janusiscus schultzei* and could be clarified with the additional findings in the type locality and horizon.

Rudimentary postorbital processes are present in the rhenanid Jagorina (Stensio 1969: fig. 90) and the porolepiforms *Porolepis* and *Glyptolepis* (Jarvik 1972: figs 20-21). Taxa in which the orbit is completely enclosed by the neurocranium (e.g., *Macropetalichthys*) or where the palatoquadrate is fused to the neurocranium (e.g., *Helodus*) are coded as uncertain for this character."

> Giles *et al*. (2015)：“This character is modified from Davis *et al*. (2012), Character  characters 76 and 93. In part, this character describes patterns of variation among transverse otic processes that bear the hyomandibular facet (see characters 125 and 164). Transverse otic processes that lack a canal for the jugular are characteristic of many chondrichthyans (e.g. *Tamiobatis*, *Xenacanthus*). In cases where taxa lack a jugular canal and have a posteriorly positioned transverse otic process, this structure is typically called a lateral otic process (e.g. Schaeffer 1981: figs. 6, 21; Coates & Sequeira 1998: fig. 6). This character is composed as a compound because there are no further dependent characters. Mathematically, this should be equivalent to atomizing and using inapplicability.”

A complete account of the craniospinal process is provided above in section 3 (\'Lateral Processes of Early Gnathostome Neurocrania\')."

> Giles *et al*. (2015): "Craniospinal process: large process extending from the posterolateral corner of the braincase, bearing a distinct craniospinal ridge, and defining the posterior margin of the embayment identified by Young (1980) as the cuccularis fossa. In many ‘placoderms’, this endoskeletal process is intimately associated with the dermal craniothoracic joint (e.g. Buchanosteus; Young 1979: fig. 2). A more modest posterolateral extension of the occipital arch, immediately posterior to the metotic fissure, is present in some early actinopterygians (e.g. Mimipiscis; Gardiner 1984: fig. 2, ‘crsp’) and has also been termed a craniospinal process (first by Nielsen 1942). A low prominence is present in a comparable location in Acanthodes (Miles 1973: pl. 5A, ‘pao.p’; Davis *et al*. 2012: supp. fig. 9, ‘Pao.p’), but is not nearly as well-developed as the actinopterygian or ‘placoderm’ craniospinal processes, being hardly noticeable in revised reconstructions (Davis *et al*. 2012 supp. fig. 15). Miles (1977: 55) drew parallels between transverse occipital processes in lungfishes in actinopterygian craniospinal processes, but remained circumspect concerning their possible homology. Gardiner (1984: 190) regarded the dipnoan and actinopterygian processes as non-homologous.  Despite  similarities  in  orientation  and  position,  the  relationship  between  the craniospinal processes of ‘placoderms’ and actinopterygians is obscure. What is clear is that the craniospinal processes of actinopterygians are proportionally smaller than, and in some ways structurally distinct from, the processes of the same name in ‘placoderms’. However,  we  are  not  confident  that  their  homology  can  be  rejected  a  priori.  We therefore consider these processes primary homologues, with this hypothesis subject to testing  through  congruence.  This  mirrors  the  strategy  applied  above  for  lateral otic/transverse  otic  processes.  Based  on  mapped  character  distributions,  our  analysis rejects  homology  between  the  craniospinal  processes  of  actinopterygians  and ‘placoderms’  (Extended  Data  Figure  7m;  cf.  optimizations  shown  in  Supplementary Figure 1)."

> Giles *et al*. (2015): "This is admittedly a compound character. This owes to the problems of rendering ratio-scale continuous characters as a discrete character. Our conceptualisation of this character is intended to capture the distinctively broad or ribbon-shaped second dorsal fins that are differentiated from any of the other median fins, and the generalized triangular shape of many gnathostomes and their relatives. In taxa possessing only a single dorsal fin, we have scored taxa where we think the observed fin is equivalent to a posterior dorsal fin. This is based on the postition of the posterior dorsal fin behind or at the level of the posterior limit of the posterior wall of the body cavity (as indicated by the position of the pelvic girdle and/or anal fin, or evidence of the body cavity present as an infill). We have reinterpreted the vertebral column of *Cowralepis*, arguing that Ritchie's (2005) reconstruction inverts the dorsoventral orientation. Ritchie's sub-haemal spines are here interpreted as dorsal or caudal fin radials. This is evidenced by the fact that the series bearing these epi-spinal elements continues under the dermal shoulder armour, while the opposing series terminates at the level of the pelvic fins (based on AMF9764, Ritchie, 2005, fig. 16 A, B). This also better explains the direction of the gentle sigmoid bend seen in several specimens (Ritchie, 2005, figs.16B, 17A, C). In photographs of specimen AMF103767 (Ritchie, 2005, fig. 1A-D, the orientation of the collapsed vertebral column can be observed. In the specimen showing the dorsal surface, the chordal surface the series lacking the accessory elements is observed, suggesting this was their ventral surface rather than dorsal."

> This character was removed by Castiello (2018) because it was is related to the metotic fissure (Castiello, 2018 Character 55) and is thus redundant.

703. Hyomandibular articulating with braincase: (0) yes; (1) no.

>  King *et al*. (2016), Character 121; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 125.

> This character was removed by Castiello (2018) because it was related with the presence of a transverse otic process (anterior postorbital process) (Castiello, 2018, Character 71) and is thus redundant.

704. Ethmoidal articulation of palatoquadrate: (0) absent; (1) present.

> King *et al*. (2016), Character 122; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 126.

> This character was removed by Castiello (2018) as it was ambiguous if the ethmoid articulation in osteichthyans is homologous to the supposed "ethmoidal articulation" in chondrichthyans and placoderms.

705. Series of paired median skull roofing bones that meet at the dorsal midline of the skull (rectilinear skull roof pattern): (0) absent; (1) present.

> Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 23; Castiello (2018), Character 155; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 160.

> Brazeau *et al*. (2023): "This character is composed as a compound because there are no further dependent characters. Mathematically, this should be equivalent to atomizing and using inapplicability."

711. Centronuchal plate: (0) absent; (1) present.

> Dupret *et al*. (2009), character 17; King *et al*. (2016), Character 238; Castiello (2018), Character 238; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 243.

> Castiello (2018): "This character was originally from Dupret et al. (2009) (ch. 17) and related to the fact that, while in most of placoderm there are two central plates flanking a median nuchal plate, in Wuttagoonaspis, Gavinaspis and phyllolepids there is a single median element, named centronuchal plate, supposed to be constituted by the fusion of central plates and the nuchal plate. King et al. (2016) changed the name of the character as related the presence of absence of a centronuchal plates. However, we think that the name of this element should not assume fusion (or reduction) of different plates, as this is a speculative pattern. Instead, sensory lines can be used as reference point to separate dermal plates in discrete elements. Here, we reformulate the character to assess the presence of a single median element carrying the central, middle and posterior pit sensory line."

> This character need to be removed because it is duplicate with Character 80.

712. Parietals or Preorbital plates at anterior edge of skull roof: (0) no; (1) yes.

>  King *et al*. (2016), Character 243; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 248.

>  Castiello (2018): "This character was created by King et al. (2016) to take in account that in some placoderms, such as Cowralepis, Eurycaraspis, Quasipetalichthys and ptyctodonts, the preorbital plates form the anterior edge of the skull roof. They considered this feature in relation of a reduction of the dermal bones of the snout. However, in Eurycaraspis and Quasipetalichtys, for example, the orbit are still surrounded by dermal bone, as the preorbital plates constitute the anterior margin of the orbit. In ptyctodonts, instead, the anterior margin of the orbit is depleted by dermal bone and the preorbital plate only makes up the lateral edge of the orbit. Given the problem of coding this character as it is currently formulated, it has been removed." 

> Deleted.

713. Paraorbital plate separating suborbital from orbit: (0) absent; (1) present.

> King *et al*. (2016), Character 253; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 258.

> Castiello (2018): "King et al. (2016) created this character to assess the presence of a dermal plate that is not associated with the palatoquadrate and extends lateral to the orbit. This plate was thought to be present in Wuttagoonaspis and possibly Brindabellaspis. However, this character might just be an automoporphy of Wuttagoonaspis as the supposed ”paraorbital” plates in Brindabellaspis are possibly just part of the large premedian plate. Character has been tentatively removed."

> Deleted.

714. Transverse external groove behind pineal opening: (0) absent; (1) present.

> King *et al*. (2016), Character 255; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 260.

Castiello (2018): "A transverse groove behind the pineal opening is present in Dicksonosteus (Goujet 1984a) and Diandongpetalichthys (Zhu 1991), but it is difficult to assess if this feature represents an anatomical or taphonomic groove".

> Retained.

> King *et al*. (2016), Character 281; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 271.

> This character was removed by Castiello (2018) as the states number are arbitrary and thus character formulation is ambiguous.

> King *et al*. (2016), Character 309; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 314.

> Castiello (2018): "The "anterior supraorbital canal" in Lunaspis are of doubtful identification and not necessarily related to the supraorbital canal. For this reason, I think this character is contentious and should be removed."

Deleted.

724. Otic canal runs along mesial margin of marginal plate: (0) absent; (1) present.

> Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 316.

This character is duplicate with Characters 672 and 673. So, it need to be removed.

729. Scales: (0) macromeric; (1) micromeric.
     
> King *et al*. (2016), Character 496; Castiello (2018), Character 485; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 501.

730. Scales with well developed pores on ganoine surface: (0) absent; (1) present.

>King *et al*. (2016), Character 497; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 502

Castiello (2018):"The absence of pores is usually considered as a feature of ganoine, so that this character might simply being related with the presence of cosmine. However, the terms "cosmine" and "ganoine" probably indicate a compound of different tissue and need to be used carefully (see Lu et al. 2016)."
