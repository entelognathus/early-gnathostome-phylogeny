# Character List: 1-685 from Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), 686-689 from Cui *et al*. (2023); 697-710 from Brazeau *et al*. (2023).

> Character 34 of Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), [macromeric vs. micromeric scales], also Character 496 of King *et al*. (2017), Character 485 of Castiello (2018), and Character 501 of Brazeau *et al*. (2023), is deleted because of vague definition of the character. Character 54, Character 145, Character 160, Character 406 and Character 450 of Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022) are deleted due to the overlooked repetition with their Characters 27, 100, 405 and 448. Character 263 of Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022) is separated into two characters, Character 259 and Character 690.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): "Hanke & Davis (2008) express uncertainty about bone cell lacunae in the scale bases of *Gladiobranchus*. However, Newman *et al*. (2012), working on the basis of better-preserved material of *Uraniacanthus* (to which *Gladiobranchus* is synonymous) show convincingly that these lacunae are lacking. *Climatius* is scored '?' in spite of Ørvig's (1967) report of acellular bases. Ørvig figured flat-based scales from the head. This character strictly concerns body scales, which may have been different. *Cheirolepis* is scored '1' based on Ørvig (1967). However, this is remarkably poorly documented in any accessioned specimens. *Acanthodes* is scored '1' based on Gross (1947) and Valiukevicius (1995). *Dialipina* is scored from Schultze (1968). *Psarolepis* is coded '0' based on Qu *et al*. (2013). The presence or absence of bone cells in the scale bases of *Brindabellaspis* is uncertain based on Burrow & Turner (1999)."

> - Score changed from 0 to 1 for Galeaspida. *Lophosteus* and *Andreolepis* are scored '0' based on Gross (1968, 1969) and Jerve *et al*. (2016).

(2017), Character 468; Castiello (2018), Character 457; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Characters 27 and 54; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 473.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015):" The character formulation of Davis *et al*. (2012) did not distinguish between ordered arrangements of fin scales and lepidotrichia. Acanthodians and *Dialipina* (uncatalogued specimen, Musem für Naturkunde, Berlin) exhibit fin web scales that are not markedly distinguished from the body scales. Fin web scales of *Dialipina* even include a distinct peg-and-socket articulation. This character thus refers to the alignment only, but not to the specialized rectangle-shaped scales in osteichthyans. *Poracanthodes* is changed to '?' because fin webs do not appear to be preserved in articulated specimens (Valiukevicius 1992). *Brachyacanthus* and *Parexus* scored '1' (pers. obs. SG, NHMUK P.130, P.38593 for *Parexus*, and NHMUK P.6959 and P.9595 *Brachyacanthus*). *Brochoadmones* is scored '0' based on observations on UALVP 41495. *Campbellodus* scored '?'."

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): "Refers to the distinct rectangular shape of the aligned lepidotrichia-like scales. This character is scored contingently on the state of the previous character. *Dialipina* is coded '0' (uncatalogued specimen, Musem für Naturkunde, Berlin)."

> - The coding of *Eosteus* is 1.

29. Epichordal lepidotrichia in caudal fin: (0) absent; (1) present.

31. Fringing fulcra: (0) absent; (1) present.

> Zhu *et al*. (2009, Character 151), Friedman & Brazeau (2010, Character 46), and references therein; Zhu *et al*. (2013), Character 145; Choo *et al*. (2017), Character 252; King *et al*. (2017), Character 467; Castiello (2018), Character 456; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Character 31; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 472.

> - Arratia (2009): "Fringing fulcra are defined here as paired structures associated with the leading edge of paired and/or unpaired fins. These may be swollen, spine-like, lanceolate, or distally arrow-like in shape."

> - Taxa without lepidotrichia are coded as 'logical impossibility'. Fringing fulcra is present in *Dialipina* and actinopterygians, absent in sarcopterygians.

> - The coding of *Eosteus* is ?.

32. Scute-like ridge scales (basal fulcra): (0) absent; (1) present.

> Giles *et al*. (2015), Character 27; Choo *et al*. (2017), Character 264; King *et al*. (2017), Character 471; Castiello (2018), Character 460; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Character 32; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 476.

> - Arratia (2009): "According to Arratia (2008), basal fulcra are defined as large, laterally expanded, paired or unpaired scale-like structures that precede the bases of the median fins or of both paired and median fins depending on the actinopterygian subgroup."

> - The coding of *Eosteus* is 1, as the dorsal margin of its upper cuadal lobe is lined with a series of basal fulcrum as in actinopterygians.

33. Flank scale alignment: (0) vertical rows; (1) oblique rows or hexagonal/rhombic packing; (2) disorganised.

> Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 14; Choo *et al*. (2017), Character 13; King *et al*. (2017), Character 491; Castiello (2018), Character 481; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Character 33; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 496.

> - The coding of *Eosteus* is 1.

34. Body scale growth pattern: (0) monodontode (monocuspid); (1) polyodontode (multicuspid).

> Hanke & Wilson (2004); Brazeau (2009); Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 8; Choo *et al*. (2017), Character 7; Coates *et al*. (2018), Character 9; King *et al*. (2017), Character 485; Castiello (2018), Character 474; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Character 35; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 490.

> - Coates *et al*. (2018): "*Gladbachus* scale crowns consistently meet the multicuspid condition. *Gladbachus* scales have been described as placoderm-like (Burrow & Turner 2013; Brazeau & Friedman 2014) and appear to have increased in size by the addition of dentine tubercles. The resultant patterns resemble closely those identified as *Ohioaspis*, attributed to the rhenanid *Asterosteus* (Gross 1973; Denison 1978) and used in the present matrix to score scale characteristics for rhenanids *Gemuendina* and *Jagorina*. This growth mode is areal, used by Brazeau and Friedman (2014) to characterise complexes of 'appositionally joined odontodes'."

> - *Entelognathus* scales bear appositionally joined odontodes (Cui *et al*., 2023).

> - The coding of *Eosteus* is 1 with joined odontodes forming linear ornament.

35. Body scale growth concentric: (0) absent; (1) present.

> Hanke & Wilson (2004); Brazeau (2009), Character 9; Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 9; Choo *et al*. (2017), Character 8; King *et al*. (2017), Character 486; Castiello (2018), Character 475; Zhu Y. *et al*. (2022), Character 36; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 491.

> - Brazeau (2009): "Body scale odontodes growing in concentric “onion skin” pattern: absent (0); present (1). This characterises the generalised concentric growth of odontodes around a single scale primordium seen in many acanthodian-type taxa and often used to diagnose acanthodians as a group. Taxa for which the superimposed odontodes do not cover the top of the crown (i.e. *Brochoadmones* and *Poracanthodes*) are scored “0”."

> - Davis *et al*. (2012): "This character is not equivalent the ‘superpositional’ character state used by Hanke & Wilson (2004). More precisely, it refers to the classic mode of acanthodian scale growth depicted in texts from Moy-Thomas & Miles (1971) onwards, and exemplified by *Acanthodes* and *Nostolepis* (shown again by Burrow & Turner 2010). Thus *Brochoadmones* (and similar taxa) coded by Hanke & Wilson (2004) and Burrow & Turner (2010) as sharing the same general superpositional mode of flank scale growth, is here coded as different (mid-sagittal sections of scales shown in Hanke & Wilson 2006)."

> - Dearden *et al*. (2021): "As Miles (1973) observed, the flank scales of *Dobunnacanthus* gen. nov. are ornamented with anteroposteriorly aligned ridges (Fig. 13C, D). These appear to be very similar to the scales of *Vernicomacanthus*, with their laterally apposed odontodes. However, because the internal structure of the scales is not preserved, it is impossible to definitively diagnose this."

> - The coding of *Eosteus* is 0.

36. Body scales with peg-and-socket articulation: (0) absent; (1) present.

> - The coding of *Entelognathus primordialis* is changed from 0 to 1 based on new data. The coding of *Gogonasus andrewsae* is changed from 0 to 1 (Long *et al*., 1997 Fig.51).

> - The coding of *Eosteus* is ?, as the detail of the scale morphology is obscure.

37. Peg on rhomboid scale: (0) longer than wide (narrow); (1) wider than long (broad).

> - Castiello (2018): "King *et al*. (2016) homologized the posterolateral extensions of the headshield present in osteostracans and in galeaspids. However, in osteostracans these extensions are related with the presence of pectoral sinus for the attachment of the pectoral fins (see Sansom, 2008). The posterolateral extensions of the headshield in galeaspids are instead non associated with paired pectoral fins and thus probably not homologous (see Zhu and Gai, 2006). For this reason, here I split the character and coding as presented in King *et al*. (2016), introducing a separated character for the posterolateral extension of Galeaspida (from Zhu and Gai 2006 character 14).“

King *et al*. (2016) changed the name of the character as related the presence of absence of a centronuchal plates. However, we think that the name of this element should not assume fusion (or reduction) of different plates, as this is a speculative pattern. Instead, sensory lines can be used as reference point to separate dermal plates in discrete elements. Here, we reformulate the character to assess the presence of a single median element carrying the central, middle and posterior pit sensory line."

> - Davis *et al*. (2012): "Basihyal, present (0); absent, hyoid arch articulates directly with basibranchial (1). Basihyals are known in chondrichthyans (Zangerl & Case 1976; Didier 1995; Grogan & Lund 2000: the glossohyal reported in *Debeerius* is indistinguishable from a basihyal) and placoderms (Ritchie 2005; Long 1997). Direct articulation between the hyoid arch and one or more basibranchials (where a basihyal is absent) occurs in *Acanthodes* and osteichthyans (Nelson 1968; Miles 1973b; Gardiner 1984: alternative reconstructions of *Acanthodes* gill arches consistently show no basihyal). The polarity of this character is questionable, given the poverty of branchial arch data in early gnathostomes. Friedman & Brazeau (2010) discuss hypohyal presence as a possible osteichthyan synapomorphy, but predetermine the hypohyals of *Debeerius* (Grogan & Lund 2000) as independently derived, and offer no comment on the hypohyal of *Cobelodus* (Zangerl & Case 1976). *Acanthodes* lacks a hypohyal."

Rudimentary postorbital processes are present in the rhenanid Jagorina (Stensio 1969: fig. 90) and the porolepiforms *Porolepis* and *Glyptolepis* (Jarvik 1972: figs 20-21).

In part, this character describes patterns of variation among transverse otic processes that bear the hyomandibular facet (see characters 125 and 164). Transverse otic processes that lack a canal for the jugular are characteristic of many chondrichthyans (e.g. *Tamiobatis*, *Xenacanthus*). In cases where taxa lack a jugular canal and have a posteriorly positioned transverse otic process, this structure is typically called a lateral otic process (e.g. Schaeffer 1981: figs. 6, 21; Coates & Sequeira 1998: fig. 6).

Such a structure is present in many placoderms (the anterior postorbital process of traditional nomenclature), chondrichthyans (the lateral otic process), and osteichthyans (the lateral commisure sensu lato). There is some variability in the structure (pierced by jugular canal versus imperforate) and location (level with the anterior or posterior of the otic capsule) of transverse otic processes among early gnathostomes.

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): "Craniospinal process: large process extending from the posterolateral corner of the braincase, bearing a distinct craniospinal ridge, and defining the posterior margin of the embayment identified by Young (1980) as the cuccularis fossa. In many ‘placoderms’, this endoskeletal process is intimately associated with the dermal craniothoracic joint (e.g. Buchanosteus; Young 1979: fig. 2). A more modest posterolateral extension of the occipital arch, immediately posterior to the metotic fissure, is present in some early actinopterygians (e.g. Mimipiscis; Gardiner 1984: fig. 2, ‘crsp’) and has also been termed a craniospinal process (first by Nielsen 1942). A low prominence is present in a comparable location in Acanthodes (Miles 1973: pl. 5A, ‘pao.p’; Davis *et al*. 2012: supp. fig. 9, ‘Pao.p’), but is not nearly as well-developed as the actinopterygian or ‘placoderm’ craniospinal processes, being hardly noticeable in revised reconstructions (Davis *et al*. 2012 supp. fig. 15). Miles (1977: 55) drew parallels between transverse occipital processes in lungfishes in actinopterygian craniospinal processes, but remained circumspect concerning their possible homology. Gardiner (1984: 190) regarded the dipnoan and actinopterygian processes as non-homologous.  Despite  similarities  in  orientation  and  position,  the  relationship  between  the craniospinal processes of ‘placoderms’ and actinopterygians is obscure. What is clear is that the craniospinal processes of actinopterygians are proportionally smaller than, and in some ways structurally distinct from, the processes of the same name in ‘placoderms’. However,  we  are  not  confident  that  their  homology  can  be  rejected  a  priori.  We therefore consider these processes primary homologues, with this hypothesis subject to testing  through  congruence.  This  mirrors  the  strategy  applied  above  for  lateral otic/transverse  otic  processes.  Based  on  mapped  character  distributions,  our  analysis rejects  homology  between  the  craniospinal  processes  of  actinopterygians  and ‘placoderms’  (Extended  Data  Figure  7m;  cf.  optimizations  shown  in  Supplementary Figure 1)."

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): "This is admittedly a compound character. This owes to the problems of rendering ratio-scale continuous characters as a discrete character. Our conceptualisation of this character is intended to capture the distinctively broad or ribbon-shaped second dorsal fins that are differentiated from any of the other median fins, and the generalized triangular shape of many gnathostomes and their relatives. In taxa possessing only a single dorsal fin, we have scored taxa where we think the observed fin is equivalent to a posterior dorsal fin. This is based on the postition of the posterior dorsal fin behind or at the level of the posterior limit of the posterior wall of the body cavity (as indicated by the position of the pelvic girdle and/or anal fin, or evidence of the body cavity present as an infill). We have reinterpreted the vertebral column of *Cowralepis*, arguing that Ritchie's (2005) reconstruction inverts the dorsoventral orientation. Ritchie's sub-haemal spines are here interpreted as dorsal or caudal fin radials. This is evidenced by the fact that the series bearing these epi-spinal elements continues under the dermal shoulder armour, while the opposing series terminates at the level of the pelvic fins (based on AMF9764, Ritchie, 2005, fig. 16 A, B). This also better explains the direction of the gentle sigmoid bend seen in several specimens (Ritchie, 2005, figs.16B, 17A, C). In photographs of specimen AMF103767 (Ritchie, 2005, fig. 1A-D, the orientation of the collapsed vertebral column can be observed. In the specimen showing the dorsal surface, the chordal surface the series lacking the accessory elements is observed, suggesting this was their ventral surface rather than dorsal."

~~711. Dorsal ridge: (0) absent; (1) present.~~

> Coates & Sequeira (1998, Character 11; 2001); Maisey (2001); Davis (2002); Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 91; Castiello (2018), Character 52; Brazeau *et al*. (2022), Character 158; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 56.

> -  Davis *et al*. (2012): "A dorsal ridge is absent in placoderms such *Brindabellaspis* and *Dicksonosteus*, but present in many early chondrichthyans, including *Akmonistion*, *Pucapampella*, *Cobelodus* and
*Cladodoides*. The primary neurocranial roof of osteichthyans such as *Eusthenopteron* (Jarvik 1980) and *Mimia* (Gardiner 1984, fig. 27: posterior face of otic region) lacks evidence of such a mid-line dorsal ridge concealed beneath the dermal skull table. In the present work, *Acanthodes* is coded as state ‘1’, ridge present (Supplementary Figures 3-5 and 15), whereas in previous studies such a ridge has been interpreted as absent."

> - Brazeau *et al*. (2023): "This character is highly problematic because the dorsal ridge is fundamentally related to the presence of opisthotic fossae for the epaxial musculature. The states are too difficult to define. This is retained in the list, but excluded from the analysis."

~~712. Paravagal fossa: (0) absent; (1) present.~~

> King *et al*. (2016), Character 98; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 102.

> - This character was removed by Castiello (2018) because it was related to the presence of a bifurcated vagal process (Castiello, 2016, Character 101; Character 509 here) and is thus redundant.

~~713. Braincase is series of bilateral ossifications: (0) no; (1) yes.~~

> King *et al*. (2016), Character 100; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 104.

> King *et al*. (2016), Character 105; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 109.

> Brazeau *et al*. (2023): "This character is excluded from the analysis because its scirubg cannot be considered phenomenologically indistinct from the presence/absence of a metotic fissure."

> - This character was removed by Castiello (2018) because it was is related to the metotic fissure (Castiello, 2018 character 56; Character 372 here) and is thus redundant.

~~715. Hyomandibular articulating with braincase: (0) yes; (1) no.~~

>  King *et al*. (2016), Character 121; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 125.

> - This character was removed by Castiello (2018) because it was related with the presence of a transverse otic process (anterior postorbital process) (Castiello, 2018, Character 77; Character 497 here) and is thus redundant.

~~716. Ethmoidal articulation of palatoquadrate: (0) absent; (1) present.~~

> King *et al*. (2016), Character 122; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 126.

> - This character was removed by Castiello (2018) as it was ambiguous whether the ethmoid articulation in osteichthyans is homologous to the supposed "ethmoidal articulation" in chondrichthyans and placoderms.

~~717. Dermal neck joint facet morphology: (0) absent; (1) ginglymoid; (2) reverse-ginglymoid.~~

> Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 178.

> - Related with King *et al*. (2016), Character 173; Castiello (2018), Character 171: Type of dermal neck-joint: (0) sliding, dermal shoulder girdle plate articulate with cephalic flat flange; (1) ginglymoid, dermal shoulder girdle condyle articulates with cephalic fossa; (2) reversed ginglymoid, dermal shoulder girdle plate articulates with cephalic transverse condyle; and (3) spoon-like, with transverse articular area.

> - Related with Zhu *et al*. (2013), Character 169; overlaps Characters 557 - 561 here.

~~718. Centronuchal plate: (0) absent; (1) present.~~

> Dupret *et al*. (2009), character 17; King *et al*. (2016), Character 238; Castiello (2018), Character 238; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 243.

> - Castiello (2018): "This character was originally from Dupret et al. (2009) (ch. 17) and related to the fact that, while in most of placoderm there are two central plates flanking a median nuchal plate, in *Wuttagoonaspis*, *Gavinaspis* and phyllolepids there is a single median element, named centronuchal plate, supposed to be constituted by the fusion of central plates and the nuchal plate. King et al. (2016) changed the name of the character as related the presence of absence of a centronuchal plates. However, we think that the name of this element should not assume fusion (or reduction) of different plates, as this is a speculative pattern. Instead, sensory lines can be used as reference point to separate dermal plates in discrete elements. Here, we reformulate the character to assess the presence of a single median element carrying the central, middle and posterior pit sensory line."

> This character need to be removed because it is redundant with Character 79 here.

~~719. Parietals or Preorbital plates at anterior edge of skull roof: (0) no; (1) yes.~~

>  King *et al*. (2016), Character 243; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 248.

>  - Castiello (2018): "This character was created by King et al. (2016) to take in account that in some placoderms, such as *Cowralepis*, *Eurycaraspis*, *Quasipetalichthys* and ptyctodonts, the preorbital plates form the anterior edge of the skull roof. They considered this feature in relation of a reduction of the dermal bones of the snout. However, in *Eurycaraspis* and *Quasipetalichtys*, for example, the orbit are still surrounded by dermal bone, as the preorbital plates constitute the anterior margin of the orbit. In ptyctodonts, instead, the anterior margin of the orbit is depleted by dermal bone and the preorbital plate only makes up the lateral edge of the orbit. Given the problem of coding this character as it is currently formulated, it has been removed." 

~~720. Paraorbital plate separating suborbital from orbit: (0) absent; (1) present.~~

> King *et al*. (2016), Character 253; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 258.

> - Castiello (2018): "King et al. (2016) created this character to assess the presence of a dermal plate that is not associated with the palatoquadrate and extends lateral to the orbit. This plate was thought to be present in *Wuttagoonaspis* and possibly *Brindabellaspis*. However, this character might just be an automoporphy of *Wuttagoonaspis* as the supposed ”paraorbital” plates in *Brindabellaspis* are possibly just part of the large premedian plate. Character has been tentatively removed."

~~721. Anterior supraorbital canal: (0) absent; (1) present.~~

> King *et al*. (2016), Character 309; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 314.

> - Castiello (2018): "The "anterior supraorbital canal" in *Lunaspis* are of doubtful identification and not necessarily related to the supraorbital canal. For this reason, I think this character is contentious and should be removed."

~~722. Maxillary and dentary tooth-bearing bones: (0) absent; (1) present.~~

> Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 45; King *et al*. (2016), Character 333; Castiello (2018), Character 325; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 338.
