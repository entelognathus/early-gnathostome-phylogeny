Ørvig figured flat-based scales from the head. This character strictly concerns body scales, which may have been different. *Cheirolepis* is scored '1' based on Ørvig (1967). However, this is remarkably poorly documented in any accessioned specimens. *Acanthodes* is scored '1' based on Gross (1947) and Valiukevicius (1995). *Dialipina* is scored from Schultze (1968). *Psarolepis* is coded '0' based on Qu *et al*.

The scales (GIT 496-8 to 496-16) are found from the same locality and horizon as the skull specimens (GIT 496-6, GIT496-7), but “cannot be definitely associated with cranial material” (Giles  *et al*., 2015). Follow this statement, the scale features in *Janusiscus schultzei* are coded ‘unknown’ in all the later data sets.

> - Castiello (2018):"This character was originally from Dupret *et al*. (2009) (ch. 17) and related to the fact that, while in most of placoderm there are two central plates flanking a median nuchal plate, in *Wuttagoonaspis*, *Gavinaspis* and phyllolepids there is a single median element, named centronuchal plate, supposed to be constituted by the fusion of central plates and the nuchal plate. King *et al*. (2016) changed the name of the character as related the presence of absence of a centronuchal plates. However, we think that the name of this element should not assume fusion (or reduction) of different plates, as this is a speculative pattern. Instead, sensory lines can be used as reference point to separate dermal plates in discrete elements. Here, we reformulate the character to assess the presence of a single median element carrying the central, middle and posterior pit sensory line."

> - Castiello (2018)："The original definition of this character stated that a prominent expansion was when the neurocranium extended far anterior to the nasal capsules. In antiarchs and acanthothoracids, this condition is present because of the posteriorly placed nostrils and anteriorly positioned jaws and associated attachments. In Macropetalichthys, Chondrenchelys and Debeerius the neurocranium does not extend far anteriorly to the nasal capsules, but rather there is an extended region between the nasal capsules and the orbits. Therefore this character was apparently previously scored as present in taxa either with posteriorly placed or extremely anteriorly placed nasal capsules, and absent in those with an intermediate condition. The definition of this character is therefore altered to apply only to taxa with very anteriorly placed nasal capsules, as posterior nasal capsules are dealt with in another character."

> - Davis *et al*. (2012): "Basihyal, present (0); absent, hyoid arch articulates directly with basibranchial (1). Basihyals are known in chondrichthyans (Zangerl & Case 1976; Didier 1995; Grogan & Lund 2000: the glossohyal reported in *Debeerius* is indistinguishable from a basihyal) and placoderms (Ritchie 2005; Long 1997). Direct articulation between the hyoid arch and one or more basibranchials (where a basihyal is absent) occurs in *Acanthodes* and osteichthyans (Nelson 1968; Miles 1973b; Gardiner 1984: alternative reconstructions of *Acanthodes* gill arches consistently show no basihyal). The polarity of this character is questionable, given the poverty of branchial arch data in early gnathostomes. Friedman & Brazeau (2010) discuss hypohyal presence as a possible osteichthyan synapomorphy, but predetermine the hypohyals of *Debeerius* (Grogan & Lund 2000) as independently derived, and offer no comment on the hypohyal of *Cobelodus* (Zangerl & Case 1976). *Acanthodes* lacks a hypohyal."
>
> - Brazeau *et al*. (2023): present (0) for *Acanthodes* after Dearden *et al*. (2019) "When contextualised *Ptomacanthus* displays a combination of derived and plesiomorphic pharyngeal traits (Fig. 4). The presence of a basihyal contacting the hyoid and first branchial arch, and the absence of hypohyals and a mineralised posterior basibranchial adds credence to the reconstruction of *Acanthodes* by Gardiner, which displays identical conditions30. These states occur in both the chondrichthyan stem-group and in the gnathostome stem-group21 suggesting that these morphologies of the ventral pharynx were likely present at the gnathostome crownnode (Fig. 4)."

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): "Here we define the postorbital process as a dorsally positioned process at the rear margin of the orbit. The postorbital process is known by a variety of names in different groups: suprapterygoid process (sarcopterygians: Jarvik 1980); supraorbital process (placoderms: Stensio 1969; Jarvik 1980); postorbital pila (in part; identified in some early sarcopterygians and *Entelegnathus*, where a bridge encloses the jugular vein: Yu 1998; Zhu *et al*. 2013); lateral commissure (in part; identified in early actinopterygians and *Ligulalepis*; Zhu *et al*. 2013). Rudimentary postorbital processes are present in the rhenanid Jagorina (Stensio 1969: fig. 90) and the porolepiforms *Porolepis* and *Glyptolepis* (Jarvik 1972: figs 20-21). Taxa in which the orbit is completely enclosed by the neurocranium (e.g., *Macropetalichthys*) or where the palatoquadrate is fused to the neurocranium (e.g., *Helodus*) are coded as uncertain for this character."

In part, this character describes patterns of variation among transverse otic processes that bear the hyomandibular facet (see characters 125 and 164). Transverse otic processes that lack a canal for the jugular are characteristic of many chondrichthyans (e.g. *Tamiobatis*, *Xenacanthus*). In cases where taxa lack a jugular canal and have a posteriorly positioned transverse otic process, this structure is typically called a lateral otic process (e.g. Schaeffer 1981: figs. 6, 21; Coates & Sequeira 1998: fig. 6). This character is composed as a compound because there are no further dependent characters. Mathematically, this should be equivalent to atomizing and using inapplicability.”

There is some variability in the structure (pierced by jugular canal versus imperforate) and location (level with the anterior or posterior of the otic capsule) of transverse otic processes among early gnathostomes.

A complete account of the craniospinal process is provided above in section 3 (\'Lateral Processes of Early Gnathostome Neurocrania\')."

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): "Craniospinal process: large process extending from the posterolateral corner of the braincase, bearing a distinct craniospinal ridge, and defining the posterior margin of the embayment identified by Young (1980) as the cuccularis fossa. In many ‘placoderms’, this endoskeletal process is intimately associated with the dermal craniothoracic joint (e.g. Buchanosteus; Young 1979: fig. 2). A more modest posterolateral extension of the occipital arch, immediately posterior to the metotic fissure, is present in some early actinopterygians (e.g. Mimipiscis; Gardiner 1984: fig. 2, ‘crsp’) and has also been termed a craniospinal process (first by Nielsen 1942). A low prominence is present in a comparable location in Acanthodes (Miles 1973: pl. 5A, ‘pao.p’; Davis *et al*. 2012: supp. fig. 9, ‘Pao.p’), but is not nearly as well-developed as the actinopterygian or ‘placoderm’ craniospinal processes, being hardly noticeable in revised reconstructions (Davis *et al*. 2012 supp. fig. 15). Miles (1977: 55) drew parallels between transverse occipital processes in lungfishes in actinopterygian craniospinal processes, but remained circumspect concerning their possible homology. Gardiner (1984: 190) regarded the dipnoan and actinopterygian processes as non-homologous.  Despite  similarities  in  orientation  and  position,  the  relationship  between  the craniospinal processes of ‘placoderms’ and actinopterygians is obscure. What is clear is that the craniospinal processes of actinopterygians are proportionally smaller than, and in some ways structurally distinct from, the processes of the same name in ‘placoderms’. However,  we  are  not  confident  that  their  homology  can  be  rejected  a  priori.  We therefore consider these processes primary homologues, with this hypothesis subject to testing  through  congruence.  This  mirrors  the  strategy  applied  above  for  lateral otic/transverse  otic  processes.  Based  on  mapped  character  distributions,  our  analysis rejects  homology  between  the  craniospinal  processes  of  actinopterygians  and ‘placoderms’  (Extended  Data  Figure  7m;  cf.  optimizations  shown  in  Supplementary Figure 1)."

> - Giles *et al*. (2015): "This is admittedly a compound character. This owes to the problems of rendering ratio-scale continuous characters as a discrete character. Our conceptualisation of this character is intended to capture the distinctively broad or ribbon-shaped second dorsal fins that are differentiated from any of the other median fins, and the generalized triangular shape of many gnathostomes and their relatives. In taxa possessing only a single dorsal fin, we have scored taxa where we think the observed fin is equivalent to a posterior dorsal fin. This is based on the postition of the posterior dorsal fin behind or at the level of the posterior limit of the posterior wall of the body cavity (as indicated by the position of the pelvic girdle and/or anal fin, or evidence of the body cavity present as an infill). We have reinterpreted the vertebral column of *Cowralepis*, arguing that Ritchie's (2005) reconstruction inverts the dorsoventral orientation. Ritchie's sub-haemal spines are here interpreted as dorsal or caudal fin radials. This is evidenced by the fact that the series bearing these epi-spinal elements continues under the dermal shoulder armour, while the opposing series terminates at the level of the pelvic fins (based on AMF9764, Ritchie, 2005, fig. 16 A, B). This also better explains the direction of the gentle sigmoid bend seen in several specimens (Ritchie, 2005, figs.16B, 17A, C). In photographs of specimen AMF103767 (Ritchie, 2005, fig. 1A-D, the orientation of the collapsed vertebral column can be observed. In the specimen showing the dorsal surface, the chordal surface the series lacking the accessory elements is observed, suggesting this was their ventral surface rather than dorsal."

> - In the taxa bearing a single dorsal fin, this character is coded inapplicable, although it is likely that the dorsal fin of antiarchs is homologous with the posterior dorsal fin if we compare them with some ptyctodonts that have two dorsal fins. The codings are changed accordingly.

**Deleted characters**

D1. Dorsal ridge: (0) absent; (1) present.

> Coates & Sequeira (1998, Character 11; 2001a, b); Maisey (2001); Davis (2002); Davis *et al*. (2012), Character 91; Castiello (2018), Character 52; Brazeau *et al*. (2022), Character 158; Andreev *et al*. (2022), Character 158; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 56.

> -  Davis *et al*. (2012): "A dorsal ridge is absent in placoderms such *Brindabellaspis* and *Dicksonosteus*, but present in many early chondrichthyans, including *Akmonistion*, *Pucapampella*, *Cobelodus* and
*Cladodoides*. The primary neurocranial roof of osteichthyans such as *Eusthenopteron* (Jarvik 1980) and *Mimia* (Gardiner 1984, fig. 27: posterior face of otic region) lacks evidence of such a mid-line dorsal ridge concealed beneath the dermal skull table. In the present work, *Acanthodes* is coded as state ‘1’, ridge present (Supplementary Figures 3-5 and 15), whereas in previous studies such a ridge has been interpreted as absent."

> - Brazeau *et al*. (2023): "This character is highly problematic because the dorsal ridge is fundamentally related to the presence of opisthotic fossae for the epaxial musculature. The states are too difficult to define. This is retained in the list, but excluded from the analysis."

D2. Paravagal fossa: (0) absent; (1) present.

> King *et al*. (2016), Character 98; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 102.

>  King *et al*. (2016), Character 121; Brazeau *et al*. (2023), Character 125.

> - Castiello (2018): "This character was originally from Dupret et al. (2009) (ch. 17) and related to the fact that, while in most of placoderm there are two central plates flanking a median nuchal plate, in *Wuttagoonaspis*, *Gavinaspis* and phyllolepids there is a single median element, named centronuchal plate, supposed to be constituted by the fusion of central plates and the nuchal plate. King et al. (2016) changed the name of the character as related the presence of absence of a centronuchal plates. However, we think that the name of this element should not assume fusion (or reduction) of different plates, as this is a speculative pattern. Instead, sensory lines can be used as reference point to separate dermal plates in discrete elements. Here, we reformulate the character to assess the presence of a single median element carrying the central, middle and posterior pit sensory line."

>  - Castiello (2018): "This character was created by King et al. (2016) to take in account that in some placoderms, such as *Cowralepis*, *Eurycaraspis*, *Quasipetalichthys* and ptyctodonts, the preorbital plates form the anterior edge of the skull roof. They considered this feature in relation of a reduction of the dermal bones of the snout. However, in *Eurycaraspis* and *Quasipetalichtys*, for example, the orbit are still surrounded by dermal bone, as the preorbital plates constitute the anterior margin of the orbit. In ptyctodonts, instead, the anterior margin of the orbit is depleted by dermal bone and the preorbital plate only makes up the lateral edge of the orbit. Given the problem of coding this character as it is currently formulated, it has been removed."

This plate was thought to be present in *Wuttagoonaspis* and possibly *Brindabellaspis*. However, this character might just be an automoporphy of *Wuttagoonaspis* as the supposed ”paraorbital” plates in *Brindabellaspis* are possibly just part of the large premedian plate.
